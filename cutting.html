    <h2>Computer Controlled Cutting</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:30px;">
      This page is dedicated to my Computer Controlled Cutting project.  
      Here, pre-programmed G-code instructions is used to precisely guide the machine's cutting tools such as lasers or drills to shape materials like metal, plastic, and vinyl. The process first begins with a CAD model, which is converted into G-code by a CAM software, then programmed into the CNC machine. The machine is prepped with the raw material and tools, then performs the cutting operations, followed by the finishing processes to complete the final design.

        <img src="imgs/about/logo.png" alt="Vector design screenshot" width="400">
        <p>I created the sticker design using the Affinity Software. The main challenge was simplifying the shapes so that the cutter could process each of them clearly.</p>

        <img src="imgs/about/thoughts.png" alt="Vinyl cutting machine in action" width="400">
        <p>I sorted the colors from the vector path to make sure every part of the logo would be accounted for. I also monitored the machine to ensure no mistakes would be made.</p>

        <h3>Weeding</h3>
        <img src="imgs/about/weeding.jpg" alt="Weeding excess vinyl" width="400">
        <p> I weeded the excess vinyl around the design's prints. The entire process was delicate, especially cutting around the thin lines around each of the letters and the explosion component.</p>

        <h3>Applying</h3>
        <img src="imgs/about/complete logo.jpg" alt="Applied vinyl sticker" width="400">
        <p>I applied transfer tape and carefully placed the entire sticker onto the designated surface. I Pressed down firmly to ensure a smooth, complete final product.</p>

      <section id="reflection">
        <h3>Mini-Reflection</h3>
        <p>The hardest part of the vinyl cutting process was weeding the fine details without tearing the design up. I solved this problem by using a weeding tool and working on it slowly. Overall, the process went smoothly even though our final vinyl design included a more than usual amount of colors.</p>

      <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
      <p>Laser cutting allowed for precise cuts on materials like wood and acrylic. Documentation for this step will be expanded later with images and notes.</p>
