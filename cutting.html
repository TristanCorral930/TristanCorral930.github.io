    <h2>Computer Controlled Cutting</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:30px;">
      This page is dedicated to my Computer Controlled Cutting project.  
      Here, I detail the process, tools, designs, and outcomes of this fabrication technique.
    </p>

    <!-- Description -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p class="project-desc">
        Computer Controlled Cutting involves the use of laser cutters and vinyl cutters to precisely shape materials.  
        In this project, I experimented with designing vector files and producing components for a larger assembly.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p class="project-desc">
        Through this project, I learned about tolerances in laser cutting, vector preparation,  
        and material limitations. The cyberpunk aesthetic was achieved by integrating glowing acrylic  
        elements with layered cuts.

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <img src="imgs/about/logo.png" alt="Vector design screenshot" width="400">
        <p>I created the sticker design using the Affinity Software. The main challenge was simplifying the shapes so that the cutter could process each of them clearly.</p>

        <h3>Cutting</h3>
        <img src="imgs/about/thoughts.png" alt="Vinyl cutting machine in action" width="400">
        <p>I sorted the colors from the vector path to make sure every part of the logo would be accounted for. I also monitored the machine to ensure no mistakes would be made.</p>

        <h3>Weeding</h3>
        <img src="imgs/about/weeding.jpg" alt="Weeding excess vinyl" width="400">
        <p> I weeded the excess vinyl around the design's prints. The entire process was delicate, especially cutting around the thin lines around each of the letters and the explosion component.</p>

      <article id="applying">
        <h3>Applying</h3>
        <img src="imgs/about/complete logo.jpg" alt="Applied vinyl sticker" width="400">
        <p>I applied transfer tape and carefully placed the entire sticker onto the designated surface. I Pressed down firmly to ensure a smooth, complete final product.</p>
      </article>

      <section id="reflection">
        <h3>Mini-Reflection</h3>
        <p>The hardest part of the vinyl cutting process was weeding the fine details without tearing the design up. I solved this problem by using a weeding tool and working on it slowly. Overall, the process went smoothly even though our final vinyl design included a more than usual amount of colors.</p>

      <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
      <p>Laser cutting allowed for precise cuts on materials like wood and acrylic. Documentation for this step will be expanded later with images and notes.</p>
