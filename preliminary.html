        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Today, the global population faces the urgent problem that our reliance on fossil fuels continues to damage the environment worldwide, and without adopting cleaner alternatives soon, the future will see worsening climate change, making electrolysis-harvested hydrogen a critical solution for sustainable energy.</p>

        <h3>Justification</h3>
        <p>Human reliance on fossil fuels has already triggered adverse environmental consequences including elevated CO₂ emissions, global warming, and air pollution—issues that will worsen unless cleaner energy alternatives are aggressively pursued. One promising alternative is electrolysis-harvested hydrogen, especially oxy-hydrogen (HHO) generated via water splitting. According to Mousa et al. (2024), a simple dry-cell HHO generator reached an efficiency of ~53.8% under optimum conditions (≈ 12.0 V, 0.10 M KOH electrolyte), with a gas production rate of 343.9 cm³/min and specific energy requirements near 3.43 kWh/m³.   These numbers show that reasonably high efficiencies are possible even with modest lab-scale setups.




Theoretical and experimental studies (Springer, 2017) further affirm that design features like electrode material, plate spacing, and electrolyte concentration significantly affect performance. For example, smaller inter-electrode distances and optimized electrolyte strength reduce internal resistance and energy losses. These studies suggest that with thoughtful engineering design, electrolysis can be made more energy efficient, less costly, and more durable.  



</p>Bridging these findings to your project: building an HHO generator will provide hands-on understanding of how voltage, electrolyte concentration, electrode configuration, and thermal management interact to influence efficiency and energy consumption. Addressing these factors in your design is feasible within student and lab constraints (budget, safety, materials) yet offers genuine potential for impact: lower greenhouse gas emissions, distributed hydrogen production, and scalable clean energy systems. Moreover, given global policy pushes toward hydrogen economy and net-zero targets, contributing experimentally to optimizing small-scale electrolysis adds value both in educational growth and real-world sustainability.



In conclusion, based on current literature showing sub-60% efficient lab-scale HHO generation and known levers for improving it, this project is both feasible and necessary. It will yield measurable outcomes (efficiency percent, energy per volume, durability) and train engineering skills aligned with sustainability challenges.
