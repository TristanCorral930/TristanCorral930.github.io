    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Tristan Corral, and I am a motivated student at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School pursuing a career in engineering. I stay actively involved in extracurricular activities such as Key Club, Abuelos Foundation, math tutoring, and Varsity Football, all of which have strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

I am bilingual in English and Spanish, certified in Fusion 360, and skilled in Google Workspace. I also founded and manage my own business, Lifeguarding Miami, where I provide professional lifeguard services for private events, and built and maintain the business website myself.

My professional experience includes internships with Franyie Engineers Inc., Pinnacle Engineering, Luxon Construction, and Athos Capital Partners (a private real estate partnership). These roles have provided me with early exposure to both engineering and business environments, allowing me to apply technical skills, collaborate with professionals, and gain insight into real-world projects.
