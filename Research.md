# H1 Oxyhrdogen Fuel Alternative
*italicized text* Today, the global population faces the urgent problem that our reliance on fossil fuels continues to damage the environment worldwide, and without adopting cleaner alternatives soon, the future will see worsening climate change, making electrolysis-harvested hydrogen a critical solution for sustainable energy.
**bold text** [Using oxy-hydrogen gas to enhance efficacy and reduce emissions of diesel engine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447923001065) -This article discusses how the use Oxy-hydrogen will improve the conditions of the enviornment compared to alternative fuels used today.
**bold text** {[Oxy-hydrogen gas as an alternative fuel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319921035497) -This article dives deeply into how Oxy-hrogen's application into the energy buisness and how it will affect the real world. Examples of such include heat and power emissions and effects on natural life.
**bold text** {[The Effect of Oxy Hydrogen Gas addition on Dry Cell Generatorâ€™s Performance](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9231745) -This article shows the designing and building of a dry-cell HHO generator. The designers tested its effect when HHO gas is added to fuel combustion in two engines. They found that adding HHO gas led to fuel consumption reductions of about 14.8% in the smaller engine and 16.3% in the larger engine. These findings show that not only is oxy-hydrogen a sustainable alternative fuel but is also as powerful as the rest.
**bold text** {[Effect of oxy hydrogen gas addition on combustion, performance, and emissions] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378382021003799) -This article is based around how Oxy hydrogen gas was used as a fuel additive in PCCI Engine and the effects that come from it. Numerous benefits would come from this addition such as Peak Pressure, Heat Release Rate, Indicated Mean Effective Pressure and Indicated Thermal Efficiency enhancements. Undoubtedly, the highest benefit would be the reduced CO, HC and Smoke emissions.
