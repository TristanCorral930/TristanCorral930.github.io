# H1 Oxyhrdogen Fuel Alternative
*italicized text* Today, the global population faces the urgent problem that our reliance on fossil fuels continues to damage the environment worldwide, and without adopting cleaner alternatives soon, the future will see worsening climate change, making electrolysis-harvested hydrogen a critical solution for sustainable energy.

**bold text** {[Oxy-hydrogen gas as an alternative fuel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319921035497) -This article dives deeply into how Oxy-hrogen's application into the energy buisness and how it will affect the real world, such as heat and power.
**bold text** {[The Effect of Oxy Hydrogen Gas addition on Dry Cell Generatorâ€™s Performance](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9231745) -This article The study designed and built a dry-cell HHO generator. They tested its effect when HHO gas is added to fuel combustion in two engines. They found that adding HHO gas led to fuel consumption reductions of about 14.8% in the smaller engine and 16.3% in the larger engine. These findings show that not only is oxy-hydrogen a sustainable alternative fuel but is also as powerful as the rest.
