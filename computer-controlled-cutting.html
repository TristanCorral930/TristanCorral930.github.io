        <h3>Design</h3>
        <img src="assets/cutting/design.png" alt="Vector design screenshot" width="400">
        <p>I created the sticker design using vector software. The main challenge was simplifying the shapes so the cutter could process them cleanly.</p>

        <h3>Cutting</h3>
        <img src="assets/cutting/cutting.jpg" alt="Vinyl cutting machine in action" width="400">
        <p>The vinyl cutter followed the vector paths and cut the design into adhesive vinyl. I monitored the machine to make sure the blade didn’t snag.</p>

        <h3>Weeding</h3>
        <img src="assets/cutting/weeding.jpg" alt="Weeding excess vinyl" width="400">
        <p>Weeding involved removing the excess vinyl around the design. This step was delicate, especially around thin lines and small details.</p>

        <h3>Applying</h3>
        <img src="assets/cutting/final.jpg" alt="Applied vinyl sticker" width="400">
        <p>I applied transfer tape and carefully placed the sticker onto a surface. Pressing down evenly ensured a smooth final application.</p>

        <h3>Mini-Reflection</h3>
        <p>The hardest part of vinyl cutting was weeding fine details without tearing the design. I solved this by using a weeding tool and working slowly under bright light.</p>

      <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
      <p>Laser cutting allowed for precise cuts on materials like wood and acrylic. Documentation for this step will be expanded later with images and notes.</p>
